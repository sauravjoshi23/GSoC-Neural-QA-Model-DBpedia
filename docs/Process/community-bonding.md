# Community Bonding

---

The community bonding period was really special. I got to know a lot of things about the community and also got familiar with the code base and the work culture. The most exciting part of this period, in particular, was the first meeting which was at 6:30pm IST on a Wednesday. Everyone first introduced themselves where we focused on talking about our background, work experience, and technologies that we are using currently. 
Next, we discussed a few things in detail:
1) Writing and maintaining a blog that should include everything that is done during the week so that it helps future potential candidates.
2) Contribution to the main branch i.e how I will contribute to the project repository.
3) Setting up a communication channel where all the doubts and issues will be discussed and cleared possibly a slack channel.
4) Focusing on the details included in the project proposal and successfully completing them during the coding period efficiently.

Finally, we discussed very general yet important topics such as the evolution of the project over the years, research, knowledge graphs, Seq2seq learning, transformers, how modern approaches are transforming the field, etc.
